##First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
FCFS is the simplest scheduling algorithm, where processes are executed based on their arrival time.
The process that arrives first is served first. This algorithm is easy to implement but can lead to poor turnaround times, especially for long processes that arrive first.

##Round Robin
Round Robin is a preemptive scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slice,
often called a time quantum or time slice. The CPU scheduler then switches between processes once their time slice expires. This ensures fairness among processes but may result in high context switch overhead.

##Banker's Algorithm
The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm. 
It is used to determine whether a requested resource allocation can be safely granted to avoid deadlock. The algorithm works by simulating resource allocation and checks whether granting a request will result in a safe state, where all processes can eventually complete.
